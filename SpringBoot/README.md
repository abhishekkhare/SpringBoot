    - [The Spring @Controller and @RestController Annotations](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-controller-vs-restcontroller)
        - **@Controller** - Classic controllers can be annotated with the @Controller annotation. This is simply a specialization of the @Component class and allows implementation classes to be autodetected through the classpath scanning. @Controller is typically used in combination with a @RequestMapping annotation used on request handling methods. The request handling method is annotated with @ResponseBody. This annotation enables automatic serialization of the return object into the HttpResponse.
        - **@RestController** - is a specialized version of the controller. It includes the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations and as a result, simplifies the controller implementation. Every request handling method of the controller class automatically serializes return objects into HttpResponse.
